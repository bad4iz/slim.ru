title: PSR 7 and Value Objects
---

Slim supports [PSR-7](https://github.com/php-fig/http-message) interfaces for
its Request and Response objects. This makes Slim flexible because it can
use _any_ PSR-7 implementation. For example, a Slim application
route does not _have_ to return an instance of `\Slim\Http\Response`. It could,
for example, return an instance of `\GuzzleHttp\Psr7\CachingStream` or any instance
returned by the `\GuzzleHttp\Psr7\stream_for()` function.

Slim provides its own PSR-7 implementation so that it works out of the box. However,
you are free to replace Slim's default PSR 7 objects with a third-party implementation.
Just override the application container's `request` and `response` services so
they return an instance of `\Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface` and
`\Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface`, respectively.

## Value objects

Slim's Request and Response objects are [_immutable value objects_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_object).
They can be "changed" only by requesting a cloned version that has updated
property values. Value objects have a nominal overhead because they must be
cloned when their properties are updated. This overhead does not affect
performance in any meaningful way.

You can request a copy of a value object by invoking any of its PSR 7
interface methods (these methods typically have a `with` prefix). For example,
a PSR 7 Response object has a `withHeader($name, $value)` method that returns a
cloned value object with the new HTTP header.

{% highlight php %}
<?php
$app = new \Slim\App;
$app->get('/foo', function ($req, $res, $args) {
    return $res->withHeader(
        'Content-Type',
        'application/json'
    );
});
$app->run();
{% endhighlight %}

The PSR 7 interface provides these methods to transform Request and Response
objects:

* `withProtocolVersion($version)`
* `withHeader($name, $value)`
* `withAddedHeader($name, $value)`
* `withoutHeader($name)`
* `withBody(StreamInterface $body)`

The PSR 7 interface provides these methods to transform Request objects:

* `withMethod($method)`
* `withUri(UriInterface $uri, $preserveHost = false)`
* `withCookieParams(array $cookies)`
* `withQueryParams(array $query)`
* `withUploadedFiles(array $uploadedFiles)`
* `withParsedBody($data)`
* `withAttribute($name, $value)`
* `withoutAttribute($name)`

The PSR 7 interface provides these methods to transform Response objects:

* `withStatus($code, $reasonPhrase = '')`

Refer to the [PSR-7 documentation](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) for more information about these methods.
